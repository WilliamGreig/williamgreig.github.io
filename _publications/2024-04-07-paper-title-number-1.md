Artificial intelligence holds immense potential across sectors like commerce, transportation, and education, but its development requires thoughtful governance. A major challenge in regulating AI is the lack of a shared understanding among stakeholders—policymakers, researchers, and the public—who possess different levels of knowledge and perspectives. This disconnect hinders effective policymaking. My research proposes that analogies can bridge these gaps by making AI’s complexities more accessible, fostering clearer communication and more informed policy decisions.
