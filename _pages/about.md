About Me
======
I’m a software engineer with a passion for solving complex problems in high-impact domains. A proud graduate of the University of Virginia with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Engineering Business, I thrive at the intersection of technology, data, and innovation. My work has ranged from building secure, scalable systems for U.S. defense and intelligence agencies to developing compliance tools for semiconductor manufacturing.
